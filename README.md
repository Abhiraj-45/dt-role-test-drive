# DT Role Test Drive Assignment – Frontend Intern

This repository contains my submission for the **DT Role Test Drive Assignment** for the Frontend Intern role.

The objective of this assignment was not only to complete the tasks, but to demonstrate **problem-solving mindset, clarity of thought, ownership, and structured execution**, as emphasized in the instructions.

## 📌 Assignment Overview

The assignment consisted of two main tasks:

### Task 1: Webpage Creation
- Create a webpage based on the given design reference.
- Although the task mentioned a Figma file, no Figma was provided.
- Therefore, the **Google Sheet layout itself was treated as the design reference**.

### Task 2: Dynamic Elements
- Use JSON objects to represent the data.
- Render the webpage dynamically using JavaScript instead of hardcoding content.

## 🧠 Approach & Thought Process

I followed a structured approach:

1. Carefully read all tabs in the Google Sheet, including the **Fair AI Usage Policy**.
2. Treated the Google Sheet as a **read-only source of truth**.
3. Identified the sheet content as structured data rather than static UI.
4. Represented the sheet content using **JSON** to keep the solution scalable.
5. Used **JavaScript** to dynamically render the UI from JSON.
6. Applied a **grid-based CSS layout** to visually match the sheet structure.
7. Ensured clear separation of:
   - Data (JSON)
   - Structure (HTML)
   - Logic (JavaScript)
   - Styling (CSS)

This approach aligns with DT’s emphasis on **clear thinking, respect for constraints, and execution of logic**.
